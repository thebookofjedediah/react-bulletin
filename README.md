This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a Bulletin created to pull announcements from a WP page and display them on this site - it is build with React, Apollo, GraphQL, and in the future Node. It is styled with Material UI.

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to the project then checkout this repo. You will need <code>[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)</code> (v7.6 or later) & <code>[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)</code> installed. You can also use <code>[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)</code> instead of <code>npm</code>. Now start the process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/thebookofjedediah/student-bulletin-react
> cd bulletin-react
> npm install or yarn install
> npm start-front or yarn start-front

_Please note that in order to get posts to render, you will have to go to the src/graphql/ApolloClient.js and change the WP link to the one that is commented out._

Thanks for looking!
