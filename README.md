Originally built to allow for students on a campus to have a place for all bulletin announcements and to submit their own, this project can have more uses with having a custom blog look or being a part of a much larger website.

Pull requests welcome!

This is a Bulletin/Blog created to pull posts from a WP page and display them on this site - it is build with React, Apollo, and WP-GraphQL. It is styled with Material UI.
